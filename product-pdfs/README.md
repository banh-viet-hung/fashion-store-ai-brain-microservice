# Product Catalog PDFs

This folder is where you should place your product catalog PDF files for the fashion store chatbot.

## How to Add Product Information

1. Create PDF files containing your product information
2. Name the files descriptively (e.g., `summer-collection-2024.pdf`, `mens-formal-wear.pdf`, etc.)
3. Place the PDF files in this directory
4. Restart the application to load the new product information

## Recommended PDF Structure

For best results, structure your PDF content with:

- Clear headings for product categories
- Product names, descriptions, prices, and specifications
- Stock information, materials, sizes, and colors
- Any special care instructions

The chatbot will use this information to answer customer questions about your products.
